These are some poster templates that may get you started. 
*That said, please be as creative as you wish.*

The only limitation is the size of your poster (2017: maximum A0, portrait).

## Sources

The latex tempalte uses [tikzposter](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tikzposter) and is based on
LianTze Lim's design in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/sample-tikzposter-poster-portrait/jfffnxhjdpgn#.WU0sbGiLSUk)
